There will be a balance of how do we bring on strategic backers for Haven1, reward our community who helped us get here with YLD holders, incentivize the top builders to come build on Haven1, and dozens of other reasons. We will try to address most in the AMA tomorrow, and will continue to roll out information over the next year. We have a dedicated team to build Haven1 that will not constrain our resources with Yield App. From my view point the future is brighter than ever. The possibility of having a major Layer1 ecosystem token that is also our membership token is very exciting to our team. As always we appreciate the support and feedback!",

Imagine if Axie Infinity was built on Haven, it would have been impossible for their millions of users to lose $600m. \n\nPeople are overlooking the longer time horizon, maybe it's a positive sign that you all plan to still be here by 2028 :)"

So I'm very confident that if you decide to go for this new project, you know what you're doing.\n\nDuring the last year, a lot of events (pretty bad events for the most part) happened, and you still managed to keep our funds safe, while delivering great yields for us. And for that you earned my absolute respect. Yield App is all about security from the start, so I think you know what you're doing with this blockchain project.\n\nToday, I believe that YieldApp needs to be better known and recognized, and this new project could be a good way to achieve that.

So I'm very confident that if you decide to go for this new project, you know what you're doing.\n\nDuring the last year, a lot of events (pretty bad events for the most part) happened, and you still managed to keep our funds safe, while delivering great yields for us.

We are all fked as YLD holders.

I joined Yield App because I've never met a team who are as talented as they are genuine. \n\nI remember 6 months ago this telegram blew up when Lucas said that all these audits are bullshit. Looking back now, you see that he was just trying to be sincere with our community and it was only months later that everyone realised he was right.\n\nRhys flagged Luna more than 3 months before ANYONE doubted it. Again, we got tremendous pushback saying that it's ridiculous for us not to support UST and that we have failed our clients by not offering 19.5% APY when they can get that safely on Anchor.  Again, in time we were proven to have the vision and tried to bring everyone with us.\n\nI remember when we first dropped rates around Dec 2021, people straight up accused us of just ripping customers off to get more profit for ourselves, despite the fact that we were able to clearly demonstrate that real yields in DeFi basically halved overnight using publicly available data. But nothing we said was enough for some.  Now it's obvious that we were simply protecting clients by not taking on additional risk and dropped rates because rates dropped, simple as that.  These actions are appreciated now, in the wake of all the ponzi schemes and so on. But time and time again, our actions are misunderstood but proven to be sound down the road. Not saying we haven't got plenty of room to improve, our failure to deliver certain features on time etc has been extensively discussed, but I can say that our intentions are always good and on the critical stuff, we have been right.\n\nIf you have a question that starts with the premise that we are \"moving away from generating yield..\" please hear my voice like a little bird on your shoulder.  Yield App, as you know it, as you expected it to be, shall continue with our stated goals and business model. \n\nWe have grown over 2022, we have a more professional, experienced team than ever. One of these teams will be building Haven1 without it taking anything away from the core business as you know it.",

Looking back now, you see that he was just trying to be sincere with our community and it was only months later that everyone realised he was right.\n\nRhys flagged Luna more than 3 months before ANYONE doubted it. Again, we got tremendous pushback saying that it's ridiculous for us not to support UST and that we have failed our clients by not offering 19.5% APY when they can get that safely on Anchor.  Again, in time we were proven to have the vision and tried to bring everyone with us.\n\nI remember when we first dropped rates around Dec 2021, people straight up accused us of just ripping customers off to get more profit for ourselves, despite the fact that we were able to clearly demonstrate that real yields in DeFi basically halved overnight using publicly available data. But nothing we said was enough for some.  Now it's obvious that we were simply protecting clients by not taking on additional risk and dropped rates because rates dropped, simple as that.  These actions are appreciated now, in the wake of all the ponzi schemes and so on. But time and time again, our actions are misunderstood but proven to be sound down the road. Not saying we haven't got plenty of room to improve, our failure to deliver certain features on time etc has been extensively discussed, but I can say that our intentions are always good and on the critical stuff, we have been right.\n\nIf you have a question that starts with the premise that we are \"moving away from generating yield..\" please hear my voice like a little bird on your shoulder.  Yield App, as you know it, as you expected it to be, shall continue with our stated goals and business model. \n\nWe have grown over 2022, we have a more professional, experienced team than ever. One of these teams will be building Haven1 without it taking anything away from the core business as you know it."

Reading in-between the lines I think they are doing this because:\n1) they are seriously concerned about retail users being regulated out of cefi/defi platforms, potentially destroying yield app as it is.\n2) thus they want to widen their offering to HNW/institutions, and they see a demand/opportunity for it anyway.\n3) they know stimulating demand and price action of a new L1 token won't be easy hence they want to bootstrap (I e. Force) it on us yielders.\n\nSo far I see their logic and think this pivot adds value. I trust their team knows the market well.\n\nTrust being the key word. Tim said multiple times there would be no more than 300M yld tokens and technically still true, it has been proposed (not set in stone) that H1 will have a billion supply.\nThis is where I disagree with them.\nWe all know what happened in 2022 and trust in cefi took a HUGE hit so to modify tokenomics now seems like a sleight of hand / backdoor way of doing things.\nShort term this will hurt yld and this can be seen from the chart. Development costs for L1 will be high and they know it so they likely want to have more tokens in reserve to fund this but I know they know maths so 300M of a token worth 3.33x more than a 1 billion supply token is the same thing.\nAnd hate to state the obvious but if tokenomics has been changed once who is to say it won't be changed again. Team has to carefully weigh options to minimise community damage. They seem open to feedback which is good, but proof is in the pudding, so we will have to wait and see.\n\nThat is why I offered some suggestions to mitigate some of the issues. I will link to it shortly.\n\nLong term H1 could be very successful (and the team has a lot of yld) so incentives for all yld holders are aligned which is good but imho unless they have a few huge clients already lined up they will struggle to hit their $5 billion AUM target in 2025.\n\nPersonally I think there are pros/cons but this has increased my uncertainty and generally I tend to de-risk as a result so that's my current thinking.\n\n",
