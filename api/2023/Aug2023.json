I’m sure you are aware of them but just in case.\n\n1) More YLD = more staking rewards.\n2) Holding token with close to zero inflation.\n3) No forced change leading to complete freedom of choice: can unstake if you wish to.\n\nWe have received a lot of positive feedback till now. However, of course I understand that we couldn’t make everybody 100% satisfied. That’s a big change indeed but it’s also change based on negative feedback related to dilution. We had to address it and meet community’s expectations."
